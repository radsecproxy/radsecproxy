This is radsecproxy 1.11.0

radsecproxy is a generic RADIUS proxy that supports both UDP and TLS
(RadSec) RADIUS transports.  There is also experimental support for
TCP and DTLS. The aim is for the proxy to have sufficient features to be 
flexible, while at the same time to be small, efficient and easy to configure.

Official packages are available:

Debian: apt-get install radsecproxy
CentOS/RHEL/Rocky: yum install epel-release; yum install radsecproxy
Fedora: dnf install radsecproxy
FreeBSD: pkg install radsecproxy
NetBSD: pkgin install radsecproxy

Or build it from this source on most Unix like systems by simply typing

    ./configure && make

For details see INSTALL

To use radsecproxy you need to create a config file which is normally found in
/etc/radsecproxy.conf or /usr/local/etc/radsecproxy.conf.  You can also specify
the location with the "-c" command line option (see below).  For further
instructions, please see the enclosed example file and the manpages
radsecproxy(8) and radsecproxy.conf(5).

Notes for Cygwin users:
- Due to a bug in openssl the tls option CACertificatePath is currently unusable.
  Use a certificate bundle with CACertificateFile instead.
- In newer versions of Cygwin, certain function calls to make internal dynamic peer 
  discovery work are not available in libresolv (the linker complains). The internal 
  dynamic peer discovery has been disabled and you're limited to static definitions 
  or an external script.
